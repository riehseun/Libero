# Libero

Libero is a social fitness app that connects people through healthy, minute-long competitions. Anyone wearing a MyO band can start the timer with a simple hand gesture, and begin.

Currently, the app can detect the number of push-ups, jumping jacks and bench presses. By analyzing muscle movement patterns, specifically in terms of Euler orientation, Libero counts the number of pushups that a user completes. Each time the proper pushup form is detected, the MyO band will vibrate, giving the user real-time feedback on the effectiveness of their workout. The app also compares the user to another person who is completing the same exercise in real time, providing a competitive element and additional motivation.
